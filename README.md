The Plymouth Interactive Social Robots dataset
==============================================

**Important**: *this repository **does not** contain the actual PInSoRo data
(~2TB would not work with GitHub!), only the meta data. See the [PInSoRo web
site](https://freeplay-sandbox.github.io/) for details to access the actual
data.*

This dataset contains 75 recordings of free-play interactions between 2 children
(45 recordings) or one child and one robot (30 recordings).

** You are very welcome to use this dataset for your own research. If you do so,

child-child and child-robot social
dynamics](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0205999) article.**

Getting started
---------------

This repository contains two things:

- the dataset **metadata** (and **data** once you have obtained the actual data)
  in the `data/` subdirectory. [Check the README.md](data/README.md) file there
  to know more about how the data is stored.
- a few tools (mainly `bash` scripts) to explore and manipulate the dataset.
  [Check the README.md](tools/README.md) to know more.

Advanced analysis tools are available as well in [a separate
repository](https://github.com/freeplay-sandbox/analysis). Check [the dataset's
website](https://freeplay-sandbox.github.io/analysing) to know more about those.
