notes:
  general: annotated by Severin
  general: they are struggling with item placement -- P is essentially using 'no' to get Y to place things -- perspective taking -> P saying 'a little bit down', Y figures that out easily from the perspective of P (same thing later for Y saying 'up' to P); mental rotation of the map for Y is difficult (the 2 bridges are swapped)
  general: many (short yet structured) play episodes -- mostly drawing
  49: start
  91: P makes a flood
  167: P "I'd rather do that [the experiment] because it like entertaining me"
  209: starting drawing a slide
  214: P to Y "do you dare colouring it", Y giggling
  267: drawing snow
  317: playing a little silly with the snow
  394: snow park, then a beach, then water...
  458: put red into water by mistake, P "pretend it is the shark eating some fish"
  496: starting to play silly
  604: starting a new play episode -- with a bit of negociation -- they are going to draw clothes for the characters
  652: drawing dress for the little girl character
  715: end of play episode
  785: new proposal from P
  883: Y "we could draw a skirt on the lion" -- giggling
  908: pick up an idea card -- pirate ship
  981: new play episode again -- all blue, about drawing mermaids -- Y gives it a first try
  1066: P takes her turn -- nice collaborative drawing sequence
  1161: screenshot -- the mermaid (Ariel)
  1305: P explain to E how Ariel knows she is 18 ;-)
  1421: still in the collaborative drawing, P is talking about who acted Ariel, etc
  1458: end of the Ariel sequence
  1522: back to Ariel (when she is human, marrying prince Harry (?))
  1563: P "this could be Rasponzel"
  1639: new play episode, drawing Rasponzel, still nice collaborative behaviour
  1759: being a bit silly now
  1825: P asks E about lunch time
  1830: started yet another princess (?) drawing
  1899: P "we want to stay until maths is finished"
  1934: less structured playing
