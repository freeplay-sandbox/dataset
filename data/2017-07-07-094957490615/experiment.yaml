  general: annotated by Severin
  general: item placement -- forgot screenshot after first child
  general: item placement -- good example of very clear, explicit locations -- especially when Y is describing
  general: item placement -- Y 'should I say 'oppo...opposite?'
  general: good cooperative behaviour - they respect each other, and negociate their choices -- Y slightly dominant
  general: nice, cooperative children!
  95: they start playing zoo together, using both items and drawing
  288: giggling because of colour swapping
  346: telling stories about what the animals are doing in the zoo
  373: explicitely decide to 'add more sand'
  405: P 'what should I make now?' Y 'I don't know' -> picking up an idea card
  451: nice negociation episode around what to do next
  505: P wants to do space, but Y eventually convince her to go for zoo (again?)
  534: zoo building, very structured
  571: perspective taking -- Y 'hippo is upside-down', P 'it's upside-down for you, but not for me'
