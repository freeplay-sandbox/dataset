notes:
  general: annotated by Severin
  general: item placements -- they struggle -- P is super shy, so started with Y
  general: item placement -- P's turn, speak incredibly low
  general: shy children, especially P
  general: good example of one child playing mostly aimlessly (B) while the other child is focusing on goal-directed drawing (Y) -- at least during the first 15min
  general: surprinsingly little speech, but a lot of giggles (especially from P)
  general: globally, little structured play (mostly local structures for some drawings, essentially from Y)
  59: start
  88: first play episode -- independent play
  124: teacher entering the room
  137: first giggles
  183: P invading Y (drawing) space, Y does not react
  231: P scribbling -- guilty/giggly look at E
  269: Y engaged into rather structured play; P less so; P giggling a lot, but does not really get Y out of her stream of activity
  385: not a lot of speech, but a lot of giggles (especially from P)
  497: P still playing silly, trying to get Y on board -- Y giggles, but keep on playing in a rather structured way
  675: filled screen in white, then drawing big hearts
  931: head pose estimation for Y should be accurate there
  974: sequence where they keep (purposefully) stealing each others the colour
  1214: P eventually draws something structured (house)
  1235: screenshot with P's house
  1450: Y to P "ok, don't go in this bit" (one of the corner); P does not really comply
  1562: playing at hidding items behind colour picker
  1716: getting more and more unstructured, on both sides
  1784: teacher briefly enter the room
